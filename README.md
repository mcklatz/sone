## Features

### Audio

- **Lossless FLAC and MQA streaming** up to Hi-Res (24-bit/192kHz) with automatic quality fallback
- **Bit-perfect output** — no resampling, no dithering. Your DAC receives the unaltered decoded signal
- **Exclusive ALSA** — bypasses PipeWire/PulseAudio entirely for direct hardware access
- **Volume normalization** (ReplayGain) with automatic context switching between album and track gain
- **Autoplay** — discovers and plays similar tracks when your queue ends

### Interface

- **Custom themes** — 9 presets and a full color picker for accent and background
- **Lyrics** — synced lyrics display for supported tracks
- **Queue persistence** — picks up where you left off across restarts
- **MPRIS integration** — media keys, desktop taskbar widgets, and system media controls
- **System tray** with playback controls and minimize-to-tray
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for all common actions with a built-in shortcut overlay

## Why SONE?

SONE is a lightweight, native alternative to the official TIDAL web player and Electron-based unofficial clients.

- **Full audio quality** — browsers and Electron apps downsample audio to 48kHz before it leaves the application. SONE is native — it outputs at the source's original sample rate, up to 192kHz (TIDAL's max). Exclusive ALSA mode bypasses the system mixer entirely for bit-perfect output to your DAC.
- **Familiar interface** — a modern UI inspired by the streaming apps you already use
- **Direct hardware access** — GStreamer talks directly to your audio hardware. Lock your DAC to the exact source format, bypassing the system mixer
- **Lightweight** — built with Tauri and Rust. Small binary, low memory footprint
- **Encrypted at rest** — credentials, cache, and settings are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **No telemetry, no tracking** — fully open source under GPL-3.0. Your listening data stays on your machine

### Building from source

**Rust:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

**Node.js** 18+ (via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), or your preferred method)

**System dependencies:**

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu / Debian</summary>

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential curl wget file patchelf \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libssl-dev \

    gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav \
    libsecret-1-dev
```

Optional (for exclusive ALSA output):

```bash
sudo apt install -y gstreamer1.0-alsa
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    gcc gcc-c++ make curl wget file patchelf \
    webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel openssl-devel \

Optional (for exclusive ALSA output):

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gstreamer1-plugins-base-tools
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Arch Linux</summary>

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed \
    base-devel curl wget file patchelf \
    webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 libayatana-appindicator librsvg openssl \
    gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-libav \
    libsecret
```

Optional (for exclusive ALSA output):

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed gst-plugin-pipewire alsa-plugins
```
</details>

**Build and run:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lullabyX/sone.git
cd sone
npm install
npm run tauri dev          # Development mode
npm run tauri build        # Release build (produces .deb, .rpm, .AppImage)
```

**Using build scripts:**

Docker-based build scripts are provided in `build-scripts/build/` to produce distro-specific packages in isolated environments. Requires Docker.

```bash
./build-scripts/build/all.sh              # Build all packages in parallel (deb, rpm, pacman)
./build-scripts/build/deb.sh              # Build .deb only (Ubuntu 22.04)
./build-scripts/build/rpm.sh              # Build .rpm only (Fedora)
./build-scripts/build/pacman.sh           # Build pacman package only (Arch)
./build-scripts/build/all.sh --omit rpm   # Build all except rpm
```

Output goes to `dist/<format>/`. Pass `--no-cache` to force a clean Docker build.

1. Launch the app
2. Enter your Client ID (and optionally Client Secret for Hi-Res — [see FAQ](#faq))
3. Click **Get Login Code** and enter the displayed code at [link.tidal.com](https://link.tidal.com)
4. Your library loads automatically — browse and play

> [!NOTE]
> **NVIDIA GPU users:** If you see a blank window, rendering glitches, or a Wayland protocol error on launch, start the app with:
> ```bash
> WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 sone
> ```

<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

**No sound?**
Make sure GStreamer plugins are installed — you need at minimum `gstreamer1.0-plugins-base`, `gstreamer1.0-plugins-good`, `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`, and `gstreamer1.0-libav` (or your distro's equivalents).

**Playback errors in exclusive/bit-perfect mode?**
Your DAC must natively support the source sample rate. If the hardware doesn't support 192kHz, exclusive mode will fail for Hi-Res streams. Try a lower quality tier or switch to normal output mode.

**"Error 71 (Protocol error) dispatching to Wayland display" on launch?**
This is a known WebKitGTK/Wayland issue affecting Tauri apps on systems with NVIDIA GPUs ([tauri-apps/tauri#10702](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10702)). As a workaround, launch SONE with the DMA-BUF renderer disabled:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 sone
```

If you're using X11 or don't have an NVIDIA GPU but still see this error, try updating your WebKitGTK and graphics drivers to the latest versions.

**Blank window or rendering glitches on NVIDIA?**
If the app launches but shows a blank/white window or has visual artifacts, try disabling WebKit's compositing mode:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 sone
```

This is a known issue with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers and WebKitGTK hardware acceleration.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>I'm getting a "Device busy" error in exclusive or bit-perfect mode</summary>

Your system's sound server (PulseAudio or PipeWire) or another application is already using the ALSA device. Exclusive and bit-perfect modes need direct hardware access — only one application can hold the device at a time.

To fix this, either close the other application using the device, or select a different output device in SONE's settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between exclusive mode and bit-perfect mode?</summary>

Both bypass your system's sound server (PulseAudio/PipeWire) and write directly to the ALSA hardware device. The difference is in how much processing happens before audio reaches your DAC.

**Exclusive mode** locks the ALSA device so no other application can use it. Audio is converted to a fixed format (32-bit integer, stereo) while preserving the source's native sample rate — no resampling occurs. You still have software volume control and volume normalization (ReplayGain).

**Bit-perfect mode** goes a step further. There is zero processing — no format conversion, no resampling, no volume control. The decoded audio reaches your DAC exactly as it was encoded. The volume slider is locked at 100% and disabled. This is the mode to use if you want the purest signal path to your DAC.

In short: exclusive gives you direct hardware access with volume control. Bit-perfect gives you a completely unaltered signal.

**TL;DR** — SONE is an open-source, native Linux desktop client for TIDAL built with Tauri 2 and Rust. It streams lossless FLAC and Hi-Res audio up to 24-bit/192kHz, with exclusive ALSA output that bypasses PulseAudio and PipeWire entirely for bit-perfect playback directly to your DAC. Lightweight, encrypted at rest, and fully offline — no telemetry, no tracking.
